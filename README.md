### FinFinFlow - The Finite inFinite Flow 

This builds upon the projects of Barry Martin, Apm1467 and IzzyTheCubeMaster and aims to develop a 3D fractal visualizer letting you explore musical flow through space & time. 

Please feel free to share, distribute and develop further on. (:

To make it work:

- Install Docker & Docker - Compose

- `dc up`

To be continued:

- Integrate Meme-pictures randomly into the space flight
